### Developer Skills
Always Google when you don't know
ex) css property to add mouse cursor to button css how to center an anchor element mdn css text align

##### Useful sites
-	stackoverflow
-	CSS-Tricks
-	developer.mozilla.org (MDN Web Docs)
-	★ https://codepen.io/pen/
Here, you can code 'html' and see how it works directly
Paste your HTML, CSS, JS codes Save the file Paste its url to stackoverflow -> This would help others see your codes and how it works a lot better

##### Debugging the code
-	Debugging : Finding and fixing errors in code
-	Most common error : no end tag, not link css file
How to find errors in HTML
-	Copy all the code of 'html'
-	Google 'html validator' ※ https://validator.w3.org/
-	Select 'Validate by Direct Input'
-	Paste your code - Click 'check'
-	Check your errors
How to compare two HTML files' codes
-	Google 'diffchecker' ※ https://www.diffchecker.com/
-	Put the original code and your code - Click 'Find Difference' This check every small changes

Tips!
-	Use 'background-color' in CSS to see the scope of the block
-	When something looks strange, click the word on the page, and try 'inspect'


### Testing Performance with Lighthouse
-	Right click the page – Inspect – Lighthouse
Click the checkbox you want to check
- Performance, Best practices, Accessibility, SEO & Desktop
Generate report
-	If everything is green, that means perfect!
-	It also tells us the problems of the page
ex) image size, color contrast, etc.
-	★ We should test the page every time before we launching it to the Internet

### Optimize images
Resize image
-	You need a program to resize the image
Squoosh : https://squoosh.app/
-	The original image size always should be almost doubled than the image that would be displayed on the screen (not more or less than double!)
Because the browser makes two pixels to one pixel to resize the picture, if the image is too big or small, it would be crashed
-	If not, resize it
-	This is especially important for big images which take up a lot of space!
-	One ‘hero’ image resizing can amazingly improve your ‘lighthouse’ result
-	After that, check browser supports : https://caniuse.com/
ex) Can I use ‘webp’
If some browsers don’t support ‘webp’, we should write code to fix this problem


### Deployment to Netlify
https://www.netlify.com/
Launch new site
-	Drag and drop the folder
-	It will automatically give you a link on the internet!
-	Rename url – Site setting
Update the source
-	Site setting – Deploys – Reupload your whole folder
Contact form
-	Code differently if you want to receive the real information from users
ex) name, phone number, email address
Netlify can handle this
-	To see users’ submissions, Site settings – Forms – Verified submissions – Click
-	You can only get 100 submissions / month
-	You can download the result file as CSV
-	If Netlify think it is spam, it automatically delete the submission
-	However, never use Netlify to handle real ‘Log-in’, it is paid (not free)
Just make the site of which input is just about contact form (name, email)
