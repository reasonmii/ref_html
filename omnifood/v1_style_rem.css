  /* (default) 1rem = 16px
  
  font-size: 10px;

  -> now 1rem = 10px
     This is recommended, because it is easy to calculate
  -> The entire layout would be changed, because the element defined by 'rem' size would change their size
  ★ This is a really really handy way to create a responsive design
  
  However, it's better to use 'percentage %' to set the font-size
  Because, it is scaled automatically based on different user's browser setting
  ex) 16px * 0.625 = 10px
  -> 0.625 : ★ Percentage of user's browser font-size setting
  Many many many web designer use this trick!

  /* ★ max-width
  - The width becomes flexible
  - It is adjusted with the size of parent element, 'body'
  - When the screen size decreased, so the size of parent element also decreased,
  and their size is less than max-width value,
  it just occupies the 100% of the parent element */
  /* max-width: 1000px; */

  /* ★ Define the width based on the font size
  1 rem = 16px (default font size)
  -> 50 rem = 800px
  Why we do this?
  - When we change the font size, it will automatically change every rem units in CSS
  ★ How?
  - If we define 'font-size: 10px;' in 'html', then 1rem will be 10px, not 16px
  - Thus, every elements which are defined by 'rem' size, would change their size automatically */
